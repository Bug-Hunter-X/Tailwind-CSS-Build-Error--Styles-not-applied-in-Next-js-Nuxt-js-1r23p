# Tailwind CSS Build Error in Next.js/Nuxt.js

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS within Next.js or Nuxt.js projects.  The problem arises when the Tailwind build process fails to correctly process configuration, leading to missing or incorrect styles.

## Problem Description:

The `bug.js` file showcases a simple Next.js component.  Despite having a `className` attribute using a valid Tailwind class, the styles are not applied due to a configuration error (intentionally created for demonstration).

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected configuration and setup needed to resolve this issue.  It highlights the key steps to ensure Tailwind correctly integrates with your build process.

## Steps to Reproduce:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the Next.js development server (or equivalent for Nuxt.js).
4. Observe that styles are missing in the `bug.js` example.
5. Modify the project to match the `bugSolution.js` configuration.
6. Re-run the server and verify that styles are now correctly applied.
